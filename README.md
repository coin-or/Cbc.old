 * Release 2.8.1:

   * Minor bug fixes

 * Release 2.8.0:

   * Introduced new secondaryStatus 8 to indicate that solving stopped due to

   * Solution pool is now accessible via the command line and the CbcMain*
     interface.
   * New mipstart option to read an initial feasible solution from a file.
     Only values for discrete variables need to be provided.

   * Added Proximity Search heuristic by Fischetti and Monaci (off by
     default): The simplest way to switch it on using stand-alone version is
     ```-proximity on```.

     Proximity Search is the new "No-Neighborhood Search" 0-1 MIP refinement
     heuristic recently proposed by Fischetti and Monaci (2012). The idea is
     to define a sub-MIP without additional constraints but with a modified
     objective function intended to attract the search in the proximity of the
     incumbent. The approach works well for 0-1 MIPs whose solution landscape
     is not too irregular (meaning the there is reasonable probability of
     finding an improved solution by flipping a small number of binary
     variables), in particular when it is applied to the first heuristic
     solutions found at the root node.
   
   * An implementation of Zero-Half-Cuts by Alberto Caprara is now available.
     By default, these cuts are off. To use add to your command line
     -zerohalfCuts root (or other options) or just -zero. So far, they may
     help only on a small subset of problems and may need some tuning.

     The implementation of these cuts is described in G. Andreello, A.
     Caprara, and M. Fischetti "Embedding Cuts in a Branch and Cut Framework:
     a Computational Study with {0,1/2}-Cuts" INFORMS Journal on Computing
     19(2), 229-238, 2007 http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0162

   * An alternative implementation of a reduce and split cut generator by
     Giacomo Nannicini is now available. By default, these cuts are off. To
     use add to your command line -reduce2AndSplitCuts root (or other
     options).

     The implementation of these cuts is described in G. Cornuejols and G.
     Nannicini "Practical strategies for generating rank-1 split cuts in
     mixed-integer linear programming" Mathematical Programming Computation
     3(4), 281-318, 2011 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12532-011-0028-6

   * An alternative robust implementation of a Gomory cut generator by Giacomo
     Nannicini is now available. By default, these cuts are off. To use add to
     your command line -GMI root (or other options).

     The implementation of these cuts is described in G. Cornuejols, F.
     Margot, and G. Nannicini "On the safety of Gomory cut generators"
     http://faculty.sutd.edu.sg/~nannicini/index.php?page=publications

   * To encourage the use of some of the more exotic/expensive cut generators
     a parameter -slowcutpasses has been added. The idea is that the code does
     these cuts just a few times - less than the more usual cuts. The default
     is 10. The cut generators identified by "may be slow" at present are just
     Lift and project and ReduceAndSplit (both versions).
   
   * Allow initialization of random seed by user. Pseudo-random numbers are
     used in Cbc and Clp. In Clp they are used to break ties in degenerate
     problems, while in Cbc heuristics such as the Feasibility Pump use them
     to decide whether to round up or down. So if a different pseudo-random
     seed is given to Clp then you may get a different continuous optimum and
     so different cuts and heuristic solutions. This can be switched on by
     setting randomSeed for Clp and/or randomCbcSeed for Cbc. The special
     value of 0 tells code to use time of day for initial seed.
   
   * Building on this idea, Andrea Lodi, Matteo Fischetti, Michele Monaci,
     Domenico Salvagnin, Yuji Shinano, and Andrea Tramontani suggest that this
     idea be improved by running at the root node with multiple copies of
     solver, each with its own different seed and then passing in the
     solutions and cuts so that the main solver has a richer set of solutions
     and possibly stronger cuts. This is switched on by setting
     -multipleRootPasses. These can also be done in parallel.
 
   * Few changes to presolve for special variables and badly scaled problems
     (in CoinUtils).

   * New option -extraVariables <number> which switches on a trivial
    re-formulation that introduces extra integer variables to group together
    variables with same cost.

   * For some problems, cut generators and general branching work better if
     the problem would be infeasible if the cost is too high. If the new
     option -constraintFromCutoff is set, the objective function is added as a
     constraint which rhs is set to the current cutoff value (objective value
     of best known solution).

 * Release 2.7.8:

   * Change message when LP simplex iteration limit is hit from "Exiting on
     maximum nodes" to "Exiting on maximum number of iterations"
   * Fix for using overlapping SOS.
   * Fixes in buildsystem.

 * Release 2.7.7:

   * Fix to report interruption on user event if SIGINT is received by
     CbcSolver. model->status() should now be 5 if this event happened. Added
     method CbcModel::sayEventHappened() to make cbc stop due to an 'user
     event'.
